## An Open Source Control Line Timer Project

Touch and Go is an open source software program to create your own basic timer for an electric powered control line model aircraft.  Utilizing a $9 Adafruit Industries Trinket M0 microcontroller development board the timer is compact, light-weight and simple to use.   With a few taps of your finger the timer can be quickly programmed at the flying field to change the time delay before start-up, the length of the flight and the RPM setting of the motor.  Because itâ€™s open source, you can customize the functionality to your liking or even add new features.

## Project Philosophy

This project developed from a desire to promote interest in electric powered control line.  It had to be simple to make and use with minimal components.
